# Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object. Each element (node) of a list consists of two items: the data and a reference (link) to the next node. The last node has a reference to null. The entry point into a linked list is called the head of the list. It should be noted that head is not a separate node, but the reference to the first node. If the list is empty then the head is a null reference.

## Types of Linked Lists

There are three common types of linked lists:

1. **Singly Linked List**: Each node has only one reference to the next node.
2. **Doubly Linked List**: Each node has two references, one to the next node and another to the previous node.
3. **Circular Linked List**: Last node has a reference to the first node as well as the next node.

## Operations on Linked Lists

The following operations can be performed on a linked list:

1. **Insertion**: Adds an element to the linked list.
2. **Deletion**: Removes an element from the linked list.
3. **Traversal**: Visits each element of the linked list.
4. **Searching**: Searches for an element in the linked list.
5. **Sorting**: Sorts the linked list.
