# C Programming Basics

This README provides an overview of essential concepts in C programming. Whether you're a beginner or need a quick reference, this guide will help you understand and use these fundamental concepts.

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators perform mathematical operations. They include:
- Addition `+`
- Subtraction `-`
- Multiplication `*`
- Division `/`
- Modulus `%`

Usage:
```c
int a = 10, b = 5, result;
result = a + b; // Addition
result = a - b; // Subtraction
result = a * b; // Multiplication
result = a / b; // Division
result = a % b; // Modulus
